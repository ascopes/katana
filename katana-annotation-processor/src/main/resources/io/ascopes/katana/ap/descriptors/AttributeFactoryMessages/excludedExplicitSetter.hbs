Setter for attribute {{quoted attributeName}} was excluded, but explicitly defined.
Generation of a setter method was disabled via the @Setters.Exclude annotation on
the getter, but an explicit setter with signature {{quoted explicitSetter}} was
defined.

Remove the exclusion annotation if you wish to have a setter generated, or remove the explicit
setter if you do not wish for a setter to be generated.
