Unexpected abstract method {{ method }} defined.
The type {{ type }} has defined an abstract method that does not
correspond to any attributes or other special methods that Katana can understand.
This means we cannot provide an implementation for it during code generation.

Either remove this method, make it static, or check that the signature and name is that of
a valid getter method.
