# katana

A project that aims to provide an annotation processor for Java 8 and newer
which can generate boilerplate data classes. 

This takes a lot of inspiration from [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
and [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/), while addressing several
fundemental downsides that I have found from using both of these tools.

The library itself is not designed to act as a replacement for
[JEP 395: Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395), but to instead compliment
it and to fill in for it on older versions of the Java Language Specification.

**This project is currently under active development and is not yet in a 
usable state. Feedback is always welcome!**
